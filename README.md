<h1>Title: Plastic FC: A Revolutionary Solution for Detecting and Removing Plastic Pollution</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Plastic pollution has become a pressing issue, particularly in our rivers and water bodies. To combat this problem, our team has developed a solution called Plastic FC. This innovative technology utilizes advanced state-of-the-art models and a user-friendly web application to detect and remove plastic from rivers, ultimately contributing to the preservation of our environment.

<h2>Solution Summary:</h2>
Our team employed YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to train the system in identifying plastic in a given set of images. This model can be utilized not only for image analysis but also for video processing, enabling the detection of plastic in real-time. By analyzing each frame of a video, Plastic FC can accurately identify plastic and geo-tag its location, facilitating the removal process and aiding in the cleaning of rivers.

<h2>Tracking and Distance Calculation:</h2>
One of the key features of Plastic FC is its ability to track the location of plastic and the user. By tracking both entities, the system calculates the distance between them, providing valuable insights into the feasibility of cleaning the river and eradicating water pollution. This information allows for efficient planning and allocation of resources, ensuring that efforts are focused on areas where plastic removal is most needed.

<h2>Architecture of the Prototype:</h2>
Our team has developed a user-friendly web application as the interface for Plastic FC. Users can upload drone shots of rivers as input images, along with their phone number for verification and getting the location of the users. This verification step ensures the authenticity of the user and their commitment to cleaning the river. Once the phone number is verified and the location is found, the system processes the image and calculates the distance between the plastic and the user's device.

<h2>Scalability of the Project:</h2>
One of the key advantages of Plastic FC is its scalability. The implementation of this solution requires only a CCTV camera near a river or a drone flying over the river, along with the trained model. This means that the solution can be easily deployed in various locations, making it adaptable to different environments and situations.

<h2>Collaboration with Authorities:</h2>
Once the plastic waste is detected, the model sends the relevant information to the concerned authorities, such as the Municipal Corporation. This enables the authorities to take immediate action and deploy a team to remove the plastic from the river. By streamlining the communication process, Plastic FC ensures a prompt response to the plastic pollution problem.


<h2>Business Value of the Solution:</h2>
The implementation of Plastic FC holds significant value for the Government of India and other organizations involved in environmental conservation. By removing plastic from rivers, we can greatly reduce water pollution and its detrimental effects on marine life. Additionally, Plastic FC can be expanded to include other non-biodegradable materials that contribute to water pollution. This comprehensive approach will further aid in minimizing water pollution and improving the overall health of our marine ecosystems.

Furthermore, the plastics extracted from the rivers can be recycled and reused by businesses. This not only promotes sustainable practices but also reduces the need for costly water purification processes. By utilizing the recycled plastic, businesses can contribute to a circular economy and reduce their environmental impact.


<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Plastic FC presents a groundbreaking solution to the global issue of plastic pollution in rivers. By harnessing the power of machine learning and advanced image processing techniques, this innovative technology enables the detection and removal of plastic, contributing to the preservation of our environment.
